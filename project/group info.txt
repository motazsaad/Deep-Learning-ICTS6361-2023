dataB 



-------------------------


Implementation 
1. split dataB into train / test 
2. use pre-trained model to predict labels in dataB test part (performance before fine-tuning) 
3. apply fine-tuning for pre-trained model using dataB train part 
4. apply fine-tuned model on test part of dataB (prediction)
5. Compare results in steps 2 and 4 (before & after)
